# The physics of ultracold atoms and molecules

This document summarises the plan for an introductory document to the science
performed on the CaF experiments in CCM.

## Atomic structure

Need to think quite carefully about the starting point, what knowledge can be
assumed? (We don't want to reproduce the Foot textbook but might basically be an
expanded version of Foot ch. 7...)

1. Zeeman effect
1. Executive summary of optical Bloch equations (what is RWA?)

## Basics of diatomic molecules

1. Bonding
1. Born-Oppenheimer

## Spectroscopy of diatomic molecules

1. Electronic structure
1. Nuclear motion
    1. Vibrational
    1. Rotational
1. Stark effect
1. Zeeman effect
1. Significant molecules:
    1. CaF
    1. RbCs

Should also include Ramsey interferometry if not in atomic structure section

## Big molecules

???

## Sources of molecules

1. Buffer gas source
1. Feschbach molecules (inc. STIRAP)
1. ???

## Laser slowing and cooling

## Sub-Doppler cooling

1. Blue-detuned molasses
1. Evaporative cooling

## Molecular MOTs

(Do we need to go through atomic MOTs first?)

1. Basic MOT
1. Dual-frequency (other theory?)
1. Special MOTs:
    1. dark SPOT
    1. blue-detuned (mainly atomic, but could do molecular?)


## Collisions

There should be quite a lot of theory to learn here

## Ongoing research 

We could have a section here about what we are working on at the moment.
